To compile and run this C program

Save the code in a file with a .c extension (e.g., roman_numeral.c) and use a C compiler such as GCC:

bash
Copy code

gcc fibonacci_series.c -o fibonacci_series


./fibonacci_series.c

The application will prompt you to enter a decimal number, and it will display the corresponding Roman numeral representation.
