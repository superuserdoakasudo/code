This function takes an integer num and a character array roman_numeral as parameters. It converts the decimal number to its Roman numeral representation and stores the result in roman_numeral.

The function uses two arrays: val and symbols. The val array contains the decimal values corresponding to Roman numerals, and the symbols array contains the corresponding Roman numeral symbols.

The main logic of the function involves repeatedly subtracting the largest possible value from the input number num and appending the corresponding symbol to roman_numeral until num becomes 0.

The main function prompts the user to enter a decimal number between 1 and 3999. If the input is valid, it calls the decimal_to_roman function and displays the Roman numeral representation. Otherwise, it displays an error message.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the program works:

The user is prompted to enter a decimal number.
The input number is stored in the decimal_number variable.
An empty character array roman_numeral of size 64 is initialized to store the Roman numeral representation.
If the input number is within the valid range (1-3999), the decimal_to_roman function is called with the decimal_number and roman_numeral arguments.
The Roman numeral representation is stored in roman_numeral.
Finally, the Roman numeral representation and the original decimal number are printed.
Note: The program assumes that the user enters a valid integer as input. It does not perform input validation for non-numeric inputs or decimals.
