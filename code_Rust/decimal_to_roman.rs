/* To compile and run this Rust program, you need to have Rust and Cargo (the Rust package manager) installed on your system.

If you haven't already installed them, you can download Rust and Cargo from the official Rust website: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

Once you have Rust and Cargo installed, follow these steps to run the Rust program:

Save the Rust code to a file with the extension ".rs", for example, "main.rs".

Open a terminal/command prompt in the directory where the ".rs" file is saved.

Create a new Rust project using Cargo with the following command:

rustc filename.rs

This command compiles and runs the Rust program. If there are any compilation errors, they will be displayed in the terminal.

Your Rust program should now be running, and you should see the output in the terminal/command prompt. */
